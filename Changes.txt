Added 4 custom skills (15 levels) for each magic school.
Added a spell book that functions like wizards do in D&D. The spell book can be used with a custom casting bar menu (default key Q to select a spell and default key R to cast it).
Added a rune crafting system. 
Added a scroll scribing system.
Added custom menus for the spell book, runes and scrolls.
Added events to the Wizard for learning magic, scroll scribing and skill reset.
Added an event to the Dwarf for learning runes.

Fixed a lot of bugs (including skill bar taking too much space, hopefully the events too.)
